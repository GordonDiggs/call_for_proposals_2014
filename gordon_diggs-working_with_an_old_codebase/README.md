# The Joys and Pains of Working With An Old Codebase

Sometimes you get to start fresh, with the latest version of ruby, the latest web server, the latest database, and your choice of dependencies. But sometimes, you have to work with an old codebase. This codebase might have been started years ago, by tens or hundreds of people, many of whom no longer work for the organization. This talk is the story of one such codebase, and how to work with it every day.

In this talk I will cover the following challenges of working with an old codebase:

* How to handle technical debt
* The unique concerns in adding features or fixing bugs
* How to plan and execute refactors
* The good parts of having an older codebase

I will talk about tools that we use to keep our code in check at Paperless Post, both local and online
